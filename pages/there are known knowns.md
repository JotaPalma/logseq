> There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns — there are things we do not know we don’t know.
— Donald Rumsfield, USA Secretary of State on a 2002 briefing about US intelligence on Iraq’s possible possession of weapons of mass destruction

## Despite the... dubious nature of the quote, it rings truth. We have a lot of knowledge that we know we’re missing, and we can go ahead and research that. But there are a lot of things we don’t know that we don’t know. That’s why the Second Brain is important, it makes connections to make us see what we do not yet know.
