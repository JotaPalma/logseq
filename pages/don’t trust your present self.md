## In the present, when you’re receiving information, it might not be interesting to you in that moment, but it will be in the future. Or vice-versa.
## Don’t make yourself regret not taking notes about something you’re passionate about, even if it doesn’t have a place in your life right now.
## Don’t trust your energy levels right now, or your motivation. Trust your passions.
