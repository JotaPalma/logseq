title: fleeting notes
---

## Always carry some writing material so that you can take notes any time, anywhere. Try to combine them all into one place, that we’ll call inbox
## ((608947ce-cef4-4233-847c-aa14f6f5f44d)) and then do write about it.
## At the end of the day or as soon as possible, process your notes, think on them, write [[permanent notes]] and store them either in the [[zettelkasten]] or into a [[reference]] system.
## Toss the fleeting notes that were already
