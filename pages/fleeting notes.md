title: fleeting notes
---

## Fleeting notes should be taken anytime, anywhere.
Try to always carry around a writing utensil so you can jot down everything that comes to mind. Doesn't matter if it's note-worthy or not.
Try to be as clear and concise about your note, write for your future self
Try to keep them all in the same place (a notebook or your phone), but what matters is jotting them down.
## Then, at the end of the day (preferrably within a day, so your memory is fresh), go through them, and sort them.
