title: fleeting notes
---

## Try to be as clear and concise about your note, [[write for your future self]]
## Try to keep them all in the same place (a notebook or your phone), but what matters is jotting them down.
## Then, at the end of the day (preferrably within a day, so your memory is fresh), go through them, and sort them.
