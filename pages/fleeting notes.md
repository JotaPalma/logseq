- Fleeting notes should be taken anytime, anywhere.
- Always carry some writing material so that you can take notes any time, anywhere. Doesn't matter if it's note-worthy or not. Try to combine them all into one place, that we’ll call [[inbox]]
- Do everything with the intention of writing about it. and then do write about it. [[read with a pen in your hand]]
- #Be as clear and concise about your note, [[write for your future self]]
- At the end of the day or as soon as possible(so your memory is fresh), process your notes, think on them, write permanent notes and store them either in the [[Zettelkasten]] or into a [[reference]] system.
- Toss the fleeting notes that were already processed, so that you have a clean workspace every day (or every couple of days). It’s a way of achieving [[inbox zero]].
