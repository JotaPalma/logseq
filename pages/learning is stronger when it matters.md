title: learning is stronger when it matters
---

## It’s a quote from [[Make it Stick]]
## We deal better with personal and concrete concepts rather than abstract ones. The stronger your connection to what you’re learning, the more motivated you are to [[learning]], and the more likely you are to have a knowledge background to help you learn
## [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]]
