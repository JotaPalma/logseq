## Can’t wait to start using this wonderful tool! I’m still reading through the original one, but boi am I excited!
## The mind forest is supposed to be an interconnected network of thoughts, resources and notes. I should do a [[weekly review]] and revisit notes, trying to make new connections or get new note ideas. I should update them regularly until they feel finished, and try to commit the important ones to memory through [[spaced repetition]].
