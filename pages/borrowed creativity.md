## No single idea is completely original.
## Every idea is a remix of different mediums.
## You watch movies, shows, youtube videos, read books, research papers, comics, etc. and make your own assumptions based on this.
## I wonder how the [[Second Brain]] will help with this. By gathering all the useful information on media I consume, I might be able to create my own content by remixing othersâ€™.
