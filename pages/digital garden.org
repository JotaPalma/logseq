** I first read about it on reddit, but the concept seems underdeveloped
** The purpose seems to be to write [[atomic notes]] and publish them, so that everyone can see them. Some people even open them for other people to edit. It has the purpose of functioning as a garden. You plant the seeds by writing a note, then you water them by adding to them, you weed them by making new connections. Some will wilt away and some will flourish and become beautiful
** I've seen a few, some don't have entry points at all, some seem like they're exclusively about taking notes (like this one is right now), few are developed to the point of having actual knowledge in them. Well, as long as they're useful to the owners, I'm okay with it.
