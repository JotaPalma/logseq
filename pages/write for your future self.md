## When we make [[fleeting notes]], we’re often doing so in a quick manner, and that’s why we should revise them one or two days after writing them, at most, and either toss them or turn them into [[permanent notes]].
## When writing permanent notes, make sure you explain why you’re thinking in this way, what led you to it. Explain it as if your future self doesn’t remember what you’re thinking right now, because they probably won’t.
## This is to say, [[don’t trust your present self]] either. Make sure you force yourself to write things in a concise way.
## Also important: even if you’re going to make your notes public, write for yourself first and foremost. This is to enrich you (me!) first. Write with your own mind in...mind.
