## Named after Soviet psychologist Bulma Zeigarnik, after visiting a restaurant where the waiters remembered exactly which orders went to each tables, but completely forgot the costumers as soon as they left the restaurant.
## Open tasks occupy memory space in our [[short-term memory]], but only until they’re completed.
## This is why unfinished tasks, no matter how small, stay on the back of our head, nagging us.
## By writing something down, we’re telling our brain to postpone thinking about it. Hence why the Getting Things Done method, by David Allen, is so effective. It involves getting all the small things out of your short-term memory so you can focus on what’s important
