## Permanent notes should be...permanent.
## They’re ever-changing, of course. The whole concept behind the [[Zettelkasten]] or the Evergreen Notes is to add to the notes as you learn new informations, to make new connections, all that.
## But we should only keep notes that will be useful to us in the future. [[write for your future self]].
## The creator of the [[Zettelkasten]] never tossed notes. Some just didn’t pop up as often (or at all), and were forgotten, just like in a memory
## They should be written with an “ignorant” public in mind.
Of course, this public is our future self. We should assume our future self doesn’t understand the thought processes behind the note, and only has basic knowledge of the topic at hand.
