## Permanent notes should be...permanent.
## Theyâ€™re ever-changing, of course. The whole concept behind the [[zettelkasten]] or the Evergreen Notes is to add to the notes as you learn new informations, to make new connections, all that.
## But we should only keep notes that will be useful to us in the future.
