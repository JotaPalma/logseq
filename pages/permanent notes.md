title: permanent notes
---

## Permanent notes should be...permanent.
## They’re ever-changing, of course. The whole concept behind the [[zettelkasten]] or the Evergreen Notes is to add to the notes as you learn new informations, to make new connections, all that.
## But we should only keep notes that will be useful to us in the future. [[write for your future self]].
## The creator of the [[zettelkasten]] never tossed notes. Some just didn’t pop up as often (or at all), and were forgotten, just like in a memory
