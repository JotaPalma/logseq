#### Summarize the information progressively and delete what isn’t important
### Express
#### Share what you’ve learned with the world
#### Hoarding information has no value if you aren’t sharing it with the world
#### Either on a blog, video format, etc.
## PARA
### Projects
#### A series of tasks connected to a goal. Could be as simple as attending a class, developing a plan, [[writing]] or planning, etc. they are all actionable tasks
### Areas of activity
#### That you want to maintain over time. They’re the topics, like Health, finance, work, school, etc.
### Resources
### Archive

#### Inactive items from the other categories
## Publishing a book is a Project, but [[writing]] is an Area
## Saving 3 months of salary is a Project, but finance is an Area
## A vacation is a Project, travel is an Area
## Projects have a completion date, and contribute to achieving goals. By completing a project, your success on that Area increases.
## Goals by themselves will probably become hobbies over time, if not connected to a project.
## Break down your goals into projects, and those projects into actions that you can take
