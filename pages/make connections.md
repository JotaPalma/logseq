title: make connections
---

## A brain learns by making connections between what you already know and the new information you’re getting. That’s why [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]].
## Instead of trying to just cram information into your brain, that you’ll likely forget once you don’t need it (due to the [[Zeigarnik effect]]), try thinking about how this new info relates to other info you know.
## The more I write on this, the more this seems like a form of [[systems thinking]].
