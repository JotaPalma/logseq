title: read with a pen in your hand
---

## Read with a pen in your hand‚Äù because, to have a decent amount of notes in your [[zettelkasten]] to use in your work, all you need is to annotate everything you consume.
## Translate it into [[your own words]] and [[make connections]].
## The arguments in your zettelkasten are shaped by the ideas, thoughts and theories in your mind. Those, in turn, are shaped and influenced by what you read or otherwise consume and, hopefully, also by the new connections made by the slip-box.
