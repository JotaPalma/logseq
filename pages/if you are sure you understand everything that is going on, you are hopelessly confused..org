** I’ve felt this for a few years. The more you know, the more you know that you don’t know. And the less you know, the more you think you know. This is definitely related to another quote, [0301 There are known knowns](https://www.notion.so/0301-There-are-known-knowns-df6ad776a7a44bc9ac4dda44394a7a7b) 

> If you are sure you understand everything that is going on, you are hopelessly confused.
