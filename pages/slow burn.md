## Instead of working on one thing for a very long time, burning yourself out, do things on a slow burn.
## Example: instead of isolating yourself on a cabin for a month to write a book, work on it a bit every day.
## In a way, Iâ€™m already implementing this. Sometimes I get excited and spend a whole day doing just one thing, but on most days I try to diversify my activities.
## Things I try to do
### Learn something new and annotate it
### Journal
### Garden
### Track habits
### Draw
