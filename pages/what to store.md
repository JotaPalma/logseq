title: What to store
Tags: #[[Second Brain]]

## Books, podcasts, YouTube videos. Everything I want my future self to remember is worth it to store.
## Capture what surprises you, because it’s likely that it’s new to you, or interesting.
## [[don’t trust your present self]], create with your future self in mind
## Instead of just capturing something without context, highlight the important parts, and comment on what it means to you.
## Don’t brainstorm for a new topic. Instead, look at the topics you already have and expand on them. New topics will arise.
## Be selective in reading and [[note-taking]], but the selection criterion is whether it adds to a discussion already present in the [[zettelkasten]]. Does it connect? Is it open to connections?
