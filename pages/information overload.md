## The average person consumes the equivalent of 174 newspapers of info a day.
## The [[Second Brain]] helps to keep up with all the information, and summarize. Every thing you consume, make a note of it, know [[What to store?]] and add it to your notes. Be it a podcast, a whole book, a single paragraph or sentence!
