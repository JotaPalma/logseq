title: knowledge shouldn’t be the main goal
---

## Related to [[the true sense of learning]].
## [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]], so knowledge is a valuable thing to have, but it shouldn’t be the goal.
## Just having information in your mind does nothing, accomplishes nothing. The goal should be to [[make connections]] between old and new knowledge, to discover new information, to make new content
