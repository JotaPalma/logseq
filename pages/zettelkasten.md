## It’s a [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
## Consists of taking notes, tagging them and making bidirectional links between them, to make connections.
## Adding new knowledge to your existing knowledge, to create ideas.
## German for “Note Box” Niklas Luhmann, a german sociologist.
## Make notes on the go. Just write every idea down as it comes to you. On paper, on Notion, phone notes, whatever. Just jot it down. Think of yourself as a collector of ideas. Jot down the source for everything.
## Tag your notes
## Find out which notes to keep. Compare them to the notes you already have with the same tags.
## This gives you a method to make connections, indexing and recalling
##
## Notes communicate with one another to create connections.

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection

## According to Niklas Luhmann’s paper on the zettelkasten, it gets to a point where it’s its own entity. It’s got a separate way of thinking and can answer questions in a non- [[linear thinking]] way
