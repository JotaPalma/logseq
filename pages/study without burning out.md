## How to create a habit of studying and making sure information is retained, and to create new connections with Sleep, Exercise, Environment and Mindset
## Sleep
### Brain gene expression during REM sleep depends on prior waking experience (Ribeiro et al. 1999)
### Sleep inspires insight (Wagner et al. 2004 (Nature))
#### 2 experiments with problem solving, 12h apart, one during the day and one with a night’s sleep between testings. The people who slept had 50% more success than the ones who didn’t
### Sleep helps retain information, consolidate memories and make new connections
### Book - Why we sleep - Matthew Walker, MD
### Tips
#### Increase bright light during the day
#### Decrease blue light in the evening
#### Avoid caffeine in the evening
#### Consistent wake\sleep cycles
#### Keep your bedroom dark and cold
## Exercise
### Exercising plays a part on memory and concentration
### The effects of cardiovascular exercise on human memory (Roig et al. 2013)
#### 2 bouts of 3 minutes of intense running on a treadmill before doing vocabulary tasks increases production of hormones in the brain and accelerated rate of learning by 20%
### Exercising before the study session or mid-session works better than after studying
## Environment
### Where are you studying?
### Use classical conditioning, sitting on a specific spot on the table makes your brain know it’s time to focus up and study

## Mindset
