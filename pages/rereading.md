## Summary:
Studying technique that involves reading the same material again (or multiple times) in an attempt to make the material “stick” to your brain. It isn’t very effective in the long term, but in short term can help with memorization.
## Notes:
### There are 3 strikes against it in the book:
#### 1. It’s time consuming. Retrieving information right after acquiring it is [[wasting time]]
#### 2. It doesn’t create durable [[memories]]
#### 3. It involves [[self-deception]]. We’re tricked into thinking we’ve mastered the content after rereading, when that’s not the case.
### The amount of study time is no measure of mastery.
### Does rereading help?
#### Multiple readings in short succession aren’t very effective.
#### Rereading a text once does help with recall, but only on the short term.
#### Rereading is time-consuming and yields negligible benefits
