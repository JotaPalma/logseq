## Named after the showman P.T. Barnum.
## Reading your crowd and making vague statements that apply to many people but *feel* personal.
## The same effect as horoscopes, they make vague statements that could apply to a number of people. Theyâ€™ll feel very on point to some people, and [[confirmation bias]] helps with this
