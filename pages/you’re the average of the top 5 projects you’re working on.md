## You’re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with, and also the average of the top 5 projects you’re working on.
## We’re at the mercy of algorithms when it comes to searching information, we’ve got almost no control over the information that’s reaching us.
## But the time we spend working on our [[Second Brain]] is intentional time, and you can use it to search and develop themes you’re actually interested and invested in.
