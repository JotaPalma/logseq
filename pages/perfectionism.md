## While wanting your work to be well done is a good thing, perfectionism is usually the enemy of getting things done.
## I’ve struggled with this a lot.
## I want things to be done perfectly, because I only get to see other people’s final product, and it seems perfect to me. So why should my thing be different?
## When I think like this, I either spend too much time on one task trying to get it to be perfect, and not enough time actually completing the task so I can move on to other tasks.
## I should stop wanting everything to be perfect.
## Instead of wanting things to be perfect, I want things to be done.
