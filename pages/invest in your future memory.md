title: invest in your future memory
---

## Tags
## Set your future self up for as much success, happiness and joy as possible, by giving them as many resources and connections as possible. This is one of the most important uses of the [[Second Brain]]
## Work with your future self in mind.
## This way you’re not starting with a blank page, you’re [[creating from abundance]] (look up Ali Abdaal’s video where he mentions this)
## I always try to be as clear as I can about why I’m [[writing]] something down, so that my future self remembers why.
