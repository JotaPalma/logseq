- The Weekly review is a method of [[organization]] and [[spaced repetition]]
- The weekly review should be done with some time on my hands, calmly. I should review all the notes made during that week, and the ones that haven’t been reviewed recently. I should try to make new connections between notes.
- It’s an important part of tending to the [[mind garden]] / [[Digital Garden]] / [[mind forest]]
