#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Learning in the true sense of the word is possible only in that
state of attention, in which there is no outer or inner compulsion.
Right thinking can come about only when the mind is not enslaved by
tradition and memory. It is attention that allows silence to come upon
the mind, which is the opening of the door to creation. That is why
attention is of the highest importance. Knowledge is necessary at the
functional level as a means of cultivating the mind, and not as an end
in itself. We are concerned, not with the development of just one
capacity, such as that of a mathematician, or a scientist, or a
musician, but with the total development of the student as a human
being.
— Jiddu Krishnamurti

## This relates to [[all new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge]], as it’s knowledge that makes the basis for new learning, but it shouldn’t be the main goal
