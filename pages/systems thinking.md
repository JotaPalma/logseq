- Systems Thinking enables you to see casual relationships that others miss, by seeing everything as a system
- The traditional thinking takes a simplistic approach to the world. Be it [[linear thinking]], [[analytical thinking]] or [[scientific thinking]]. They see the parts, but not the whole, and not how the whole interacts with other wholes around it.
- Systems thinking reveals relations between systems that wouldn’t be usually related in traditional thinking
- [[emergence]], the forming of new qualities, “the result being bigger than the sum of its parts”.
## How to:
-
  1. Find the inputs, outputs and movements
	- Entry and exit points
	- Bottlenecks, and what happens to the buildup at the bottlenecks
-
  2. Distinguish linear from circular
#### The linear ones usually enter and exit and aren’t important
### 3. Look for patterns
#### They are central to systems’ function. Find and describe them. Use flowcharts.
#### Once you find the patterns, look for similar ones in closeby systems, in the [[big picture]]. Zoom in, zoom out.
### 4. Find the feedback loops
#### Self-magnifying or self-diminiscing patterns. They indicate causality. They keep going forever and might destabilize the system.
### 5. Understand the balancing processes
#### Any system that’s sustained for a long time needs to have them to stop the system from going off the rails because of feedback loops or flaws in the system itself.
#### They maintain equilibrium and define stability
#### 6. Study the system’s interaction with other systems
## No system is functional by itself. Every system interacts with other systems, influencing and being influenced.
## Applications:
### Rewriting trains our brain to think about things with systems in mind. Makes us think about frames, patterns and [[categories]], as opposed to just trying to memorize a single, isolated fact, like in [[linear thinking]] https://logseq.com/#/page/systems%20thinking.
