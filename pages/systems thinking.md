## Systems Thinking enables you to see casual relationships that others miss, by seeing everything as a system
## The traditional thinking takes a simplistic approach to the world. Be it [[linear thinking]], [[analytical thinking]] or [[scientific thinking]]. They see the parts, but not the whole, and not how the whole interacts with other wholes around it.
\
## Systems thinking reveals relations between systems that wouldn’t be usually related in traditional thinking
## *[[emergence]]*
### New qualities forming that the components don’t have on their own.
### Example: water is wet, but neither hydrogen nor oxygen are. Only when they interact with each other and the world around them in a certain way, does this quality emerge.
## How to:
### 1. Find the inputs, outputs and movements
#### Entry and exit points
#### Bottlenecks, and what happens to the buildup at the bottlenecks
### 2. Distinguish linear from circular
#### The linear ones usually enter and exit and aren’t important
### 3. Look for patterns
#### They are central to systems’ function. Find and describe them. Use flowcharts.
#### Once you find the patterns, look for similar ones in closeby systems, in the [[big picture]]. Zoom in, zoom out.
### 4. Find the feedback loops
#### Self-magnifying or self-diminiscing patterns. They indicate causality. They keep going forever and might destabilize the system.
### 5. Understand the balancing processes
#### Any system that’s sustained for a long time needs to have them to stop the system from going off the rails because of feedback loops or flaws in the system itself.
#### They maintain equilibrium and define stability
### 6. Study the system’s interaction with other systems
## No system is functional by itself. Every system interacts with other systems, influencing and being influenced.
