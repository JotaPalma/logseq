## There are benefits to retrieving something from your memory in the form of testing.
## Tells you what you know and what you donâ€™t know, so you know what you need to study further.
## Helps the brain reconsolidate the memory, strengthens the connections to what you already know and makes it easier to recall in the future.
## Retrieval interrupts forgetting
