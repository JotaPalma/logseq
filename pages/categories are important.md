## Creating [[categories]] is important. Especially in the beginning, it’s easier to just create Categories about topics that interest you or you find relevant. For example, Life, [[feminism]] , [[mental health]], [[productivity]].
## As your [[Second Brain]] evolves, though, and you know What to store, these categories will prove themselves too broad and hard to make connections with, so you’ll need to create more notes and establish those connections, and watch your forest grow.
