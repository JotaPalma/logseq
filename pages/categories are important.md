## Creating [[categories]] is important. Especially in the beginning, it’s easier to just create Categories about topics that interest you or you find relevant. For example, Life, [[feminism]] , [[mental health]], [[productivity]].
## As your [[Second Brain]] evolves, though, and you know [[What to store]], these categories will prove themselves too broad and hard to [[make connections]] with, so you’ll need to create more notes and establish those connections, and watch your forest grow.
## In the the [[Zettelkasten]] Method, it’s better to not have categories, to help make new connections that might escape you if you’re putting all your notes into boxes. It’s better to use hashtags
