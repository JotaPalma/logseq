## Creating [[categories]] is important. Especially in the beginning, it’s easier to just create Categories about topics that interest you or you find relevant. For example, Life, [[feminism]] , [[mental health]], [[productivity]].
## As your [[Second Brain]] evolves, though, and you know [[What to store?]], these categories will prove themselves too broad and hard to [[brains are for making connections, not storing information]] with, so you’ll need to create more notes and establish those connections, and watch your forest grow.
