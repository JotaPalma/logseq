title: inbox zero
---

## Definition
### It is the principle that your email inbox should always be kept empty, so as not to be a tool for distraction and procrastination, but for [[productivity]].
## When at work, don’t check the email constantly. Schedule a reasonable amount of times you’ll check it (could be once a day, twice, every hour, etc).
## If an email can be replied to in less than 2 minutes, do so immediately. This will free up mental space.
## Archive things you no longer need to see in your inbox
## Use the folder/label function to separate emails into categories.
## Create a category for emails you need to spend some time replying, or that require your attention later. After all, [[categories are important]].
