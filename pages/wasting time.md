** Definition

A bad use of time, time spent doing useless or unnecessary things. This can mean 3 things

1. Doing nothing.
2. Not producing anything
3. Not contributing toward your goals
** Can time be truly wasted?

Objectively, no. Regardless of what you do with your time, it will keep moving forward.
**
** Are there benefits to wasting your time?

As it turns out, yes. A study compared problem solving in 3 groups of people. One who had to answer immediately, one who had to actively think about the problem and then answer, and one who was distracted doing something else and then had to answer. The third group solved the problem better, faster and more efficiently.
** Conclusion

So, we can conclude that distracting yourself from your tasks or duties can help you to do better when you come back to them.

Of course, you shouldn’t waste all day every day. That's [[procrastination]]. Set aside some time to distract yourself, go on a walk, meditate, scroll through social media, or just do plain old nothing!

Besides, if you don’t regret the time you wasted, it wasn’t really wasted!
