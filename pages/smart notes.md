## The HOW in [[How to Take Smart Notes]]:
1. Make [[fleeting notes]], into an inbox, to be sorted later. Don’t sweat it about syntax or cohesiveness. Write it on your phone, a notebook, a napkin, whatever.
2. Make literature notes about whatever you read. Jot down everything you don’t want to forget. Use [[your own words]]. Make notes on the quotes you do keep. These notes will be your reference system, your bibliography
3. Make permanent notes. Instead of simply collecting your notes, develop them. Think about where they fit into your existing information, combine ideas to generate something new [[emergence]].
4. Add the permanent notes to the zettelkasten. Put the notes “behind” relevant notes by using links, so that there are no orphaned notes. Add links to relevant notes. Make sure you find the note later by either putting it in an index or making a link to it on an entry-level note.
5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects from the bottom up. See what notes you have, what points are missing. Read more. Take more notes. Develop your system. 
—Don’t brainstorm for a new topic. Instead, look at the topics you already have and expand on them. New topics will arise.—
6. When writing about a subject, choose one already in your system. Lay out all the relevant notes in front of you, so that you can see what’s there, what’s reduntant, what needs to be developed. Allow yourself to come back to it after reading more on the subjects. Improve your ideas and arguments.
7. Turn the notes into a rough draft. Don’t copy-paste. Write them in your own words, again. “Translate” them into a single text.
8. Edit and proofread. Congrats, you’ve written a manuscript!
