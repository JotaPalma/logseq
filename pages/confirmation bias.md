title: confirmation bias
---

## Confirmation Bias makes you surround yourself by people who think like you because they think like you. It also tries to impede you from researching for subjects or arguments that disprove or argue against what you believe in. A way to stop this from affecting you and your work is by acknowledging it exists, like Charles Darwin. He wrote down every thought he had that could go against his research or belief.
## With the [[zettelkasten]], we tackle this by turning the writing process “on its head” (writing from the bottom up), and by changing your priorities, from finding facts that confirm your own thoughts, to gathering any relevant information to the given topic, no matter the argument it’ll support or disprove.
