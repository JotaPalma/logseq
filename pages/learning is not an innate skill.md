### #Learning
## While genetics plays a part on our starting point, our brain is pliable.
## Every time you learn something new, you change the brain.
## We become capable through [[Learning]] and development and make our own mental models that help us reason, solve and create.
## If you’re good at [[Learning]] , you’ll have an advantage in life. It requires memory, continuous learning and is an acquired skill.
## Gains achieved during massed practice or [[rereading]] are transitory and melt away quickly.
## [[Learning]] is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful.
