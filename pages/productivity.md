title: productivity

## As much as I’m against [[capitalism]]’s notion of being as productive as possible, I also feel my best when I’m [[Learning]] and creating.
## I also struggle with [[time management]] and [[motivation]], so I’d like to know ways to use my time more effectively so I can work, keep doing my hobbies, learning, and have time for a family and social life in the remaining time.
