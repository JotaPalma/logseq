## My memory is bad. It’s not the most reliable thing. I think I do need the @0101 Second Brain because, if I rely on my brain, I won’t be able to recall new information before it gets stored in my long-term memory
## But I do understand that this all can become an entangled web of connections, and I might not even use it in the future, but I do think it’s a neat tool for the time I’ll be using it.
