title: creating from abundance

## If you have a collection of notes, a [[zettelkasten]] or other [[Second Brain]], you’re never really starting from a blank page.
## Whatever the topic, you can go to your notes and find whole lines of thought related to that subject.
## For example, right now I’m reading [[How to Take Smart Notes]] and [[Make it Stick]], and I’m amassing notes about them. If I want to, I can write a blog post or article about smart note-taking, study techniques, the [[zettelkasten]] and how it all relates, by searching my notes and turning them into a draft. As I read more and expand my notes to further subjects, I’ll be able to write about them, too!
## Even with “normal” methods of creating, we’re never really starting with a blank page. We have prior knowledge. We picked the subject to write about because we knew *something* about it. We don’t just pluck questions out of the air. They come from all the information we consumed that is somehow related to the subject or project at hand.
