## Definition
### It is a [[learning]] technique where you write down questions about the subject, and come to them periodically to answer them.
### It is mentioned in the book [[Make it Stick]].
## According to Make it Stick, the most effective [[Learning]] strategies are not intuitive.
## Spaced Repetition of key ideas, and the interleaving of different but related topics, help the brain retrieve information better in the long run.
## If learners spread out their study of a topic, periodically over time, theyâ€™ll remember it.
## How spaced out should repetition be?
### When you space out practice and are in the process of forgetting, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort has longer lasting effects and allows for more versatile application in later settings.
