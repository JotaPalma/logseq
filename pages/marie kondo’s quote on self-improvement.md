title: Marie Kondo’s quote on self-improvement

## When we’re bettering ourselves, it’s to become a better person. We should do things for this new and better person we’re becoming. That’s why you [[don’t trust your present self]].
## It’s worth mentioning that Marie’s book is about letting go of clutter, and thanking objects for the service they did during their time with you. We shouldn’t keep a lot of keepsakes just for the memories. We should thank the person we were, and embrace the person we became.

It is not our memories but the person we have become of those past experiences we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.
