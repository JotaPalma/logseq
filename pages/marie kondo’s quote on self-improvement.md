## When we’re bettering ourselves, it’s to become a better person. We should do things for this new and better person we’re becoming. That’s why you [[don’t trust your present self]].
## It’s worth mentioning that Marie’s book is about letting go of clutter, and thanking objects for the service they did during their time with you. We shouldn’t keep a lot of keepsakes just for the memories. We should thank the person we were, and embrace the person we became.
