## What is it?
### Instead of [[writing]] and summarizing, write a ton of questions for yourself, and when revising, you answer the questions a few times and that is your study method.
### See if you can feasibly answer the questions. Not necessarily by [[writing]] them down, but in your head, or out loud
## [[testing]] can be a way of doing active recall, especially in the form of low-stakes testing and self-quizzing.
