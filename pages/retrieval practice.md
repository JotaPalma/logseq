## Recalling facts or concepts or events from memory. Recalling through [[spaced repetition]] Example: flashcards. It strengthens the memory and interrupts forgetting
## Thinking about what you did and what you could have done better helps you retain information and use it to do better next time.
## Repeated [[active recall]] helps memory consolidate from short- to long-term.
## When recall is spaced, allowing some forgetting to happen between each [[testing]], it leads to stronger long-term retention.
