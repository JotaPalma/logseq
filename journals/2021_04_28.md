## Downloaded Obsidian on Sérgio’s laptop to try it out. Looks good and cool, but I’ll stick with logseq for now. At least I can carry it around in my ipad and phone, and don’t have to wait for a pc to be able to use it. I’m still getting the hang of it, but it’s good for what I want.
## Sérgio’s mom got her first covid vaccine this morning. Pfizer. Next one will be on May 26th, 2021, at 10h15
